## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We follow **Git Flow**:

```
main
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop (default branch for PRs)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/your-feature-name
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/issue-123
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/improve-readme
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/critical-bug (only for prod fixes)
```

**Branch naming conventions:**

- `feature/short-description` - New features
- `bugfix/issue-123` - Bug fixes (reference issue number)
- `docs/what-you-updated` - Documentation
- `test/what-you-tested` - Test improvements
- `refactor/what-you-refactored` - Code refactoring
- `perf/what-you-optimized` - Performance improvements

### Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

## üíª Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow **PEP 8** with some extensions:

- **Line length**: 100 characters (not 79)
- **Docstrings**: Google style
- **Type hints**: Required for public functions
- **Imports**: Organized with `isort`

### Formatting Tools

**Black** (code formatter):
```bash
black app/ tests/
```

**Ruff** (linter):
```bash
ruff check app/ tests/
```

**isort** (import sorting):
```bash
isort app/ tests/
```

**mypy** (type checking):
```bash
mypy app/
```

**Run all checks:**
```bash
make lint  # or
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Code Structure

**File organization:**

```python
"""Module docstring explaining purpose.

Example:
    from app.models import AudioModel
    
    audio = AudioModel(path="audio.mp3")
"""

# Standard library imports
import os
from typing import Optional, List

# Third-party imports
import numpy as np
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Local imports
from app.utils import helper_function

# Constants
MAX_AUDIO_DURATION = 14400  # 4 hours in seconds

# Classes and functions
class AudioProcessor:
    """Process audio files for transcription.
    
    Attributes:
        model_name: Name of the Whisper model to use.
        device: Device to run inference on ('cpu', 'cuda').
    
    Example:
        >>> processor = AudioProcessor(model_name="large-v3-turbo")
        >>> result = processor.transcribe("audio.mp3")
    """
    
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "large-v3-turbo", device: str = "cpu"):
        """Initialize the audio processor.
        
        Args:
            model_name: Whisper model variant.
            device: Computation device.
        """
        self.model_name = model_name
        self.device = device
    
    def transcribe(self, audio_path: str) -> dict:
        """Transcribe audio file to text.
        
        Args:
            audio_path: Path to audio file.
        
        Returns:
            Dictionary with 'text', 'segments', 'language'.
        
        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If audio file doesn't exist.
            ValueError: If audio format is unsupported.
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Docstring Format (Google Style)

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> dict:
    """One-line summary.
    
    Longer description if needed. Explain what the function does,
    any important details, algorithms used, etc.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1.
        param2: Description of param2. Defaults to 10.
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If param1 is empty.
        TypeError: If param2 is not an integer.
    
    Example:
        >>> result = function_name("test", 20)
        >>> print(result)
        {'key': 'value'}
    """
    pass
```

### Type Hints

**Required for:**
- All public functions
- Function parameters
- Return types

**Example:**

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any

def process_audios(
    audio_paths: List[str],
    model: str = "whisper-large-v3-turbo",
    options: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Process multiple audio files."""
    if options is None:
        options = {}
    # Implementation
    return []
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # Fast, isolated tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Tests with dependencies (DB, Redis)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/            # End-to-end tests (full pipeline)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/       # Test data and fixtures
```

### Writing Tests

**Unit test example:**

```python
import pytest
from app.processors.whisper import WhisperProcessor

class TestWhisperProcessor:
    """Tests for WhisperProcessor class."""
    
    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test processor initializes correctly."""
        processor = WhisperProcessor(model_name="tiny")
        assert processor.model_name == "tiny"
        assert processor.device == "cpu"
    
    def test_transcribe_valid_audio(self, sample_audio_file):
        """Test transcription of valid audio file."""
        processor = WhisperProcessor()
        result = processor.transcribe(sample_audio_file)
        
        assert "text" in result
        assert "segments" in result
        assert len(result["text"]) > 0
    
    def test_transcribe_missing_file_raises_error(self):
        """Test error handling for missing file."""
        processor = WhisperProcessor()
        
        with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
            processor.transcribe("nonexistent.mp3")
```

**Using fixtures:**

```python
# conftest.py
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

@pytest.fixture
def sample_audio_file(tmp_path):
    """Create a temporary audio file for testing."""
    audio_path = tmp_path / "test_audio.mp3"
    # Create dummy audio file
    audio_path.write_bytes(b"fake audio content")
    return str(audio_path)

@pytest.fixture
def db_session():
    """Provide a test database session."""
    # Setup test database
    session = create_test_db_session()
    yield session
    # Cleanup
    session.close()
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_whisper.py

# Specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_whisper.py::TestWhisperProcessor::test_transcribe_valid_audio

# With coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Parallel execution (faster)
pytest -n auto

# Verbose
pytest -v -s

# Stop on first failure
pytest -x
```

### Coverage Requirements

- **Unit tests**: >80% coverage
- **Integration tests**: Critical paths covered
- **E2E tests**: Main user workflows covered

**Check coverage:**

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
# View HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

**All public APIs must have:**
- Module docstring
- Class docstring
- Function/method docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises
- Example usage

**Inline comments:**
- Explain **why**, not **what**
- Use for complex logic
- Keep concise

```python
# Good: Explains why
# Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
retry_delay = 2 ** attempt

# Bad: States the obvious
# Set retry_delay to 2 to the power of attempt
retry_delay = 2 ** attempt
```

### Documentation Files

When adding/changing features, update:

- `README.md` - If it affects quick start or main features
- `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` - If it's a user-facing feature
- `docs/guides/API_REFERENCE.md` - If you change API
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Always add entry for your change

### Writing Style

- **Clear and concise**: Short sentences, active voice
- **Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **User perspective**: Write for the reader (user/developer)
- **Consistent terminology**: Use same terms throughout
